 **Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project**   

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings Through SQL queries, focusing on key metrics such as booking cancellations, guest preferences, revenue trends, and seasonal patterns. The goal was to provide data-driven recommendations to improve hotel performance and enhance the guest experience.  

**Steps I took:**  
1️⃣ **Data Preparation**: lead data from excel to microsoft sql server.     
2️⃣ **Data Exploration**: Used SQL to explore the data, answering key questions like:  
   - What are the booking trends by hotel type and season?  
   - What factors influence cancellations?  
   - Which room types and meal plans are most popular?  
3️⃣ **Analysis**: Identified trends such as peak booking seasons, guest preferences, and revenue drivers.  
4️⃣ **Visualization**: Created clear and insightful visualizations to present the findings.  
5️⃣ **Recommendations**: Provided actionable strategies to reduce cancellations, improve guest satisfaction, and boost revenue.  

**Key Findings:**  
- **City Hotels** dominate bookings (60.31%) and revenue, but have higher cancellation rates (36.75%).  
- **Summer months (July & August)** are the busiest, while **November & December** are the slowest.  
- **Room Type A** and the **Bed & Breakfast (BB)** meal plan are the most popular among guests.  
- Only **3.87%** of guests are returning customers, highlighting a need for better loyalty programs.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Implement dynamic pricing during peak seasons and promotions for off-peak months.  
- Enhance guest loyalty programs to increase repeat bookings.  
- Focus on fulfilling special requests to improve guest satisfaction.  
- Optimize room assignments and promote direct bookings to reduce dependency on OTAs.  

This project was a great opportunity to apply my SQL and data analysis skills to real-world hospitality challenges. I’m proud of the insights uncovered and the actionable recommendations that can help hotels thrive in a competitive market.
